## Instructions

1. **Team Formation:** Form teams of 3-4 students each. Ensure diversity in team composition to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
2. **Git Repository Setup:** Each team will create a Git repository on GitHub to serve as the central repository for the project. Assign a team member as the repository owner responsible for setting up the repository and adding collaborators. 📂
3. **Problem Selection:** Choose programming problem provided below. 🎯
4. **Problem-Solving:** Teams will collaboratively solve each selected problem by writing code, committing changes, and pushing to their team's Git repository. 🛠️
5. **Document the Approach:** Document the approach, algorithm, and code implementation for each problem within the team's Git repository. Include explanations, analysis of time and space complexity, and any assumptions made. 📝

## Problem Selection

### Simple Static Website 🌐

Design and develop a simple static website for a fictional business, organization, or personal portfolio. The website should include multiple pages (e.g., home, about, contact), navigation menu, responsive design, and relevant content (text, images, links). 🖼️

#### Requirements

- Use HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript to create the website. 🚀
- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. 📱
